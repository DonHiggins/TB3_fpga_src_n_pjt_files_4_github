Rev_01.03.03_F2 

08/04/2016 --	In initial testing in TB3IOMC, AD7682 (ADC for Anlg_In_1,2,3&4) works ok, but not
               code for 24-bit AD7175 (ADC for Anlg_In_8,6,7&8).  Rather than approach the problem
					directly, first I'm going to try to get rid of the synthesis warnings.

					Got rid of several synthesis warnings for "truncation" by adding unused ms bit
					on the front of some counters.
					
					Removed The TA "Test App" module, used in TB3IOMA, testing reads and writes
					over the bus from DSP to FPGA. It also supported ability to read certain static
					values from the FPGA.  So this is no longer supported.

8/08/2016 --   Trying to fix a bug that shows up in FPGA, not in simulation.  Symptom is that ctrl_busy
               never returns low after communicating with AD7175.  I think the problem was caused by a
					simple mistake in line 338 of ADC_App.v and I solved it by changing a comparison value
					from a 0 to a 1, returning ad7175_start_ctrl LOW after seeing ctrl_busy HI.

8/10/2016 --   Added support to Switch_App.v to control 4 new switches that select input into
               24-bit AD7175 A-to-D converter, Analog Input B1.  Four choices are (1) standard
               analog input scaling +/-12.5V pin input to 0-to-5V ADC input, (2) Bare input from Pin
               (w/2k resistor & protection diodes), (3)Gnd, (4)+2.5V Ref.					

8/12/2016 --   small mod to ADC_AD7175_Ctrl.v, troubleshooting failure of FPGA machine to
               successfully read data in "continuous conversion" mode.

               so I rolled to a new project to try to fix that.
					
					Probably need to inventory all my I/O pins before loading code into FPFA2.
					May even want to scrutenize the warnings from synthesis.
					
07/18/2016 --  I/O Pins look good.  I added 2nd LED.

07/20/2016  -- Adding SLOW_HEARTBEAT into repetoir of LED Paterns
					
07/21/2016  -- Switches connecting Digital Outputs to IO Pins changed from MAX4661 (normally closed)
               to MAX4662 (Normally open).  But, we do have inverters in-line between FPGA and Switches.
					So, we want default FPGA signal values to be HI, so switches will be open by default.
					I've decided to maintain the 0/1 sense of the signal in communications from PC to DSP to FPGA
					and just invert the signals before putting them out the FPGA pins.

08/03/2016  -- Investigating difference between I/O Pin switch values written to FPGA and read Back from

09/18/2015 -- generally, SSEnc works pretty well.  I have it
              working w/ DSP code to do the 3 interchanges in the phase-detect.
				  
				  Added 2 fixes here, (1) don't cut off xmit on last clk-low, wait till
				  following rising edge. (2) when we receive 8-bit reg for position, left shift
				  the data into the ms octet of data returned to DSP, putting it where DSP
				  looks for Mode commands.
				  
				  At this point it does phase-detect for Endat 2.1.
				  Probably need to look at an Endat 2.2 drive to see what it is looking for.
				  Need to look at what RC's test routines call for testing FLASH memory in MotionPlatform.

              working w/ DSP code to do the first 2 interchanges in the phase-detect.
				  The 3rd interchange balks because the FPGA leaves the 8-bit

				  rather than shifting it up to the ms 8 bits where the DSP is looking for 
				  a Mode comand.  I'm going to save this and pursue improvements in the next version.

05/21/2015 -- Before adding Analog inputs 5 thru 8, need Filter_Clk for MAXIM octal filter
              For Today, just added the filter clock.  Make sure it works before

100_Tb3iomB_Fpga1

11/7/2014 -- Starting out with new ISE project
             Used same design project properties as in 028_2xDB, used for TB3IOMA
				 
				 For starters I'll create a UCF and Top level Verilog file to define pin-outs
				 and possibly Initial Hi or Low state for outputs.
				 
				 Did much more -- actually took whole functionality from 028_2xDB, 
				 Changed pin-outs,
				 Cut out the 2nd instanciation of the functionality (virtual FPGA2 on 2nd bus),
				 Added what may be a generally useful way to pass low level signals to testpoints,
				 Decreased from 4 to 2 LED's.
